# Toggle Code Generation

As we all know, when connecting a signal in Godot Editor, it will automatically generate callback code at the end of the script. Sometimes it's not flexible (especially with C#).

This plugin can prevent code auto-generation and add a handler to control which language can auto-generate code.
